Both arrays may contain duplicate elements. For each element in <code>a[]</code>, your task is to count how many elements in <code>b[]</code> are less than or equal to that element.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input:</strong> a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9], b = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4]
<strong>Output: </strong>[4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]<strong>
Explanation: </strong>
For a[0] = 1, there are 4 elements in b (0, 1, 1, 1) that are ≤ 1.
For a[1] = 2, there are 5 elements in b (0, 1, 1, 1, 2) that are ≤ 2.
For a[2] = 3, there are 5 elements in b that are ≤ 3.
Similarly, for a[3] = 4, there are 6 elements in b that are ≤ 4, and for a[4] = 7 and a[5] = 9, there are also 6 elements in b that are ≤ 7 and ≤ 9, respectively.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input:</strong> a[] = [4, 8, 7, 5, 1], b = [4, 48, 3, 0, 1, 1, 5]
<strong>Output: </strong>[5, 6, 6, 6, 3]
<strong>Explanation: <br></strong>For a[0] = 4, there are 5 elements in b (4, 3, 0, 1, 1) that are ≤ 4.
For a[1] = 8 and a[2] = 7, there are 6 elements in b that are ≤ 8 and ≤ 7.
For a[3] = 5, there are 6 elements in b that are ≤ 5.
For a[4] = 1, there are 3 elements in b (0, 1, 1) that are ≤ 1.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input:</strong> a[] = [10, 20], b = [30, 40, 50]
<strong>Output: </strong>[0, 0]
<strong>Explanation: <br></strong>For a[0] = 10 and a[1] = 20, there are no elements in b that are less than or equal to 10 or 20. Hence, the output is [0, 0].</span></pre>
